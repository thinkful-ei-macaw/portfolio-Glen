Hello, my name is Glen. A full stack web developer with a deep passion and love for technology.

Bio

You still with me? Awesome! I have been coding and doing web development for the past 2 years and when I was first introduced to it, I knew I found my calling in the career field. Utilizing technologies such as HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript to bring about solutions to your problems gives me the warm fuzzies and it's something I can see doing for many, many years to come. 

The times I am away from my computer not creating wonderful things, I can found working out, playing my gutiar, or drinking way to much coffee with my other software developer friends as we road trip to various tech meetups and networking events.
